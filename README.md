I have used 
TRUNCATE movies
TRUNCATE ratings
codes to clean all rows in the table.
I added that code too

According to votes, The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption, and Your name are the best movies. 
Ratings of them are 8.5
Although, these high ratings the most popular movie is Minions, and its rating is just 6.4
Minions are followed by Wonder Woman, and its popularity is 294
All these movies are created to earn money from movie producers. According to revenue most successful movies

1-Avatar $2.78 billion
2-Star Wars: The Force Awakens $2.07 billion
3-Titanic: $1.85 billion 

Profit and success are not about the budget. 
Although Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides had the most significant budget ($380 million), it has only $665 million profit.

However, The Blair witch Project is the most profitable movie in history. It has only a $60.000 budget, and it has $248 million in revenue.

37 of the 100 movies with the most revenue are children movies. Movie producers make $36 billion from these children's movies. This shows that children are essential customers for movie makers.
